# Hello, I'm Gustavo!

## Data Scientist, Statiscian, and Research consultant

My passion was always doing research and solving problems. I wanted to do science for as long as I can remember!
Fortunately, I've been able to fullfil this dream. Currently, I run a consulting business, working with all kinds of data, machine Learning and research.

Main things I can help with:

- ü§ñ Any kind of Machine Learning (or AI) solutions, including theoretical!
- üîé I can structure your research project! Anything from a simple survey to large-scale projects. It doesn't even need to be in tech!
- üìà Statistics! I can analyze and find useful insights in data, including any data obtained through a previously structured study.
  - üåè This way, I can help you with your research from the very beginning to the very end!

I have experience working with research and data for numerous different fields, but here's some of them:

- Marketing, sales, consumer analysis, and other adjacent fields!
- Neuroscience, bioinformatics, and other areas of biology and health!
- Supply chain, predictive quality, devops and many different industrial applications.
- Sociology, psychology, anthropology and other fields from the human sciences.
- Sports, cinema, literature, and other media.

Last but not least, my list of proficiencies include many fields in AI and Statistics, including:

- Deep Learning, including natural language processing, LLMs, computer vision, fraud detection, and many others.
- Machine Learning for many different kinds of data such as geographic, financial, visual, among others, for any objective such as forecasts, predictions, classification and recommendation systems, and many more.
- Statistics, from exploratory analysis, business analytics, market research and similar, to skills necessary for experiment design, such as checking and adjusting for biases, assigning subjects to groups, etc.


Currently, I've been working on improving my knowledge in other realms of science, constantly reviewing my statistics background, doing research, and working towards reaching a wider online public with my business.
